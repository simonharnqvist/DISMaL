# DISMaL: Demographic Inference under the Structured Coalescent using Maximum Likelihood

``DISMaL`` is a Python package for inferring historical demographies (specifically, population sizes, gene flow, and split times) from sequence data. It is an implementation of the *Generalised isolation-with-migration* (GIM) model of Costa & Wilkinson-Herbots (2021). Please cite their paper if you use ``DISMaL`` in published work:

Documentation and tutorials are forthcoming.
